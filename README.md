# CoronaStats

<a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/raphtlw" data-size="large" aria-label="Follow @raphtlw on GitHub">Follow @raphtlw</a>

A Flutter app which shows the statistics of the Corona Virus.

I created this app because I couldn't find any good Corona Virus tracking apps on the play store, some were either filled with ads or the design was too messy.

## Download

<!-- The app can be downloaded from the [Play Store]() -->
The app can be downloaded from the [Github Releases](https://github.com/raphtlw/coronastats/releases) page

> Please note that downloading the app from the releases page will cause a popup to show where Google says the app may be "insecure". Just ignore that popup.
