# CoronaStats

A Flutter app which shows the statistics of the CoronaVirus.

I created this app because I couldn't find any good CoronaVirus tracking apps on the play store, some were either filled with ads or the design was too messy.

## Download

The app can be downloaded from the [Github releases page]()
